# KattisProblems-Kotlin

# <h1> Solutions of some Kattis problems with Kotlin

This is the second repository for Kattis problems, you can read the other readme file on [Python](https://github.com/ardaPhysTech/KattisProblems-Python). I'm using 

Kotlin as my second language, because it's speed is really slow on Kattis compared to Python and C++. Normally Kotlin should be faster than Python, this kinda
seems weird, maybe there is something wrong with their Kotlin compiler. On my Kotlin solutions, i tried to use Kotlin standard library built-in extension functions 
as much as i can, less code more work, as known as functional programming. Kotlin really has amazing and beautiful extension functions, if you don't understand
functions i write just google them and look for them in kotlin lang's documentation. If you want to look for more complex questions, you can find them on my Python 
Kattis solutions repository.
